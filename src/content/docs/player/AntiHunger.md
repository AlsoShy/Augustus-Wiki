title: AntiHunger
description: Prevents hunger while traveling on the map
---

This function is useful because there are servers with skypvp mode and others, where you spend hunger, this function allows you to slow down this effect, which allows you to move more around the map and spend less food. This function bypasses such anti-cheats as AAC, NCP, Matrix (I'm not sure about new versions, but you can try) and others.

❗But I do not guarantee that it can work everywhere, test the function on servers where you can check each anticheat and see the results❗
