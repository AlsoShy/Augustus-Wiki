title: AntiFire
description: Prevents fire from the player
---

This module performs the function of preventing fire from the player. Or rather, if you suddenly enter the fire, you will not burn for long, the more packages you install in "MaxPacketsPerTick" the faster you are extinguished.
 
 ❗But keep in mind that if you install a lot of packages, there is a risk that you will be kicked for a huge number of packages❗

Also, this function is not designed for servers with a good anti-cheat, it can help on vanilla servers, on servers where there is NСP and other weak anti-cheats

# OnlyOnGround

Works only if the player is standing on the ground, allows you to bypass a little more anti-cheats and reduce the chance of being kicked from the server
