Automatically respawns the player character upon death without the need for manual intervention.

This is useful if you want to automate some work or just not to perform unnecessary actions.

The sliders "MinDelay" and "MaxDelay" are responsible for the time after which the respawn will be performed, so you can choose the timing you need.
