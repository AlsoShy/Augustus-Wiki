This page will list terminology that is used in Augustus and appears multiple times inside the client

## Rotation
A rotation is any kind of movement your player figure can do on its own axis. Meaning turning around is countet as a rotation, looking up also. Pretty much anything that makes your player figure "rotate" around is counted as a rotation

The y-rotation referses to turning left,right,behind and front

The x-rotation referses to turning up and down


## Min and Max
Augustus has many options where you can select min and max for stuff. If the min and max value are not the same Augustus will take random values between those two.
